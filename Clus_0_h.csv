Abstract;Year
Systems methods and computer-readable media provide entity relation extraction across sentences in a document using distant supervision. A computing device can receive an input such as a document comprising a plurality of sentences. The computing device can identify syntactic and/or semantic links between words in a sentence and/or between words in different sentences and extract relationships between entities throughout the document. A knowledge base (e.g. a table chart database etc.) of entity relations based on the extracted relationships can be populated. An output of the populated knowledge base can be used by a classifier to identify additional relationships between entities in various documents. Machine learning can be applied to train the classifier to predict relations between entities. The classifier can be trained using known entity relations syntactic links and/or semantic links.</p>;2017

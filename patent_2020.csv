2020,"Of the four primary approaches to processing language by computer, only the parsing approach considers the semantic and syntactic components from the start. In doing so, however, the required resources expand rapidly as the scope of the language processed increases. And as that scope increases, the performance of parsing systems decreases. A natural language processor uses a tumbling-frequency phrase-chain parser as described herein which circumvents this resource-intensive step in parsing, while quickly and almost effortlessly arriving at higher speeds and greater efficiency in natural-language processing with far more accurate results involving a partitioning dictionary and phrase chains, and, more particularly, to the discovery that a small and finite set of â€œphrase chainsâ€ created using a parsing-based phrase-chain processor accounts for a considerable percentage of human language. The significance of this result is that these phrase chains, once identified, can be programmatically pre-encoded for deep structure (meaning) thus allowing for simpler, faster, and more accurate natural language processing at a semantic level than other known parsing approaches."

One of the methods includes performing word segmentation on text to be predicted to obtain a plurality of words. For each word of the plurality of words, a determination is made whether the word has a pre-trained word vector. In response to determining that the word has a pre-trained word vector, the pre-trained word vector for the word is obtained. In response to determining that the word does not have a pre-trained word vector, a word vector for the word is determined based on a pre-trained stroke vector. The word vector and the pre-trained stroke vector are trained based on a text sample and a word vector model.

Then, applying the configuration that lower level segments of the respective names are the same. Next, sequentially generating electronic files which are changed to complete a one-round through only higher-level segments of the names. The lower level segments are automatically copied during the process of the above one-round. Finally, the electronic files are combined into one file or jumps to each other with another file that is not finally combined.1. There are cases where an electronic file jumps to another file without final combining. In this case, even if there are many anchors and hyperlinks in the electronic file, these are not changed at all. Only a different html file has been created. In other words, replacing only file names that appear outside the file is efficient because of the small number of operations.2. There are cases where hyperlinks jump in a final combined file.

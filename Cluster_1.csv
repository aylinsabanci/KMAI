"The invention relates to a land surface temperature estimation method based on expert knowledge-model-data driving and machine learning. It can provide accurate surface temperature data for remote sensing departments such as satellite sensor design meteorology agricultural drought and environmental monitoring. This method overcomes the shortcomings of traditional methods which need to obtain prior knowledge of land surface type and atmospheric water vapor and overcomes the shortcomings of difficulty in obtaining key parameters. According to the corresponding sensor band setting based on the radiation transmission balance equation and expert knowledge the method analyzes how to obtain the four unknowns of the single equation namely the surface temperature the atmospheric transmittance the surface emissivity and the average atmospheric action temperature and determines the best band combination for the sensor to carry out the surface temperature inversion and then uses the machine learning method to carry out the optimization calculation. Then according to different sensor bands the radiation transmission simulation database is constructed by using the radiation transmission model. If there are reliable ground station data and on-board data it can be supplemented appropriately so as to construct the training and test database. Then a dynamic learning neural network model is constructed to learn and calculate the surface temperature. If the accuracy does not meet the requirements through verification and comparison the database is reconstructed and tested repeatedly until the accuracy meets the conditions.
